Entities Comparison API 

This repository contains the **C# .NET backend API** for the [Entity Comparison Web App Frontend](https://github.com/Marileni/entity-comparison-webapp).  
It was developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis in Computer Science.

You can download this repository and open that project in visual studio.
After, select the RUN button in visual studio and the APIs are ready.
You can use them very easily in swagger.
